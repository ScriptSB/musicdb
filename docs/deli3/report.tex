\section{ER model}
After reading the feedback of diverable1, we modified our ER model as below:\\ \\
\includegraphics[width=14cm]{ERmodel}\\ \\
In the given project data, we firstly recognize 'area', 'artist' and 'genre' each as three individual entities. Each artist is from at most one area, so it's a many-to-one relation. Several artists can belong to different genres and one genre can contain several artists. So the relation between 'artist' and 'genre' is many-to-many.\\ \\
Secondly, we think about the relationship among 'release', 'recording', track' and 'medium'. We imagine a scene to describe these relations. The csv file of 'release' contains the names of releases. They could be stored in the mediums, such as CD, 12‚Äù Vinyl and so on. What's more, one release could have several CDs to contain many tracks, or in different medium (I'm not sure about this, but possible). So the relation between 'release' and 'medium' is one-to-many. Next, each track in different mediums must correspond to one recording. So the relation between 'track' and 'recording' is many-to-one. Each 'track' must be in one of 'medium's. So the relation is many-to-one.\\ \\
Finally, we merge one-to-may relations. 'release' and 'medium' are merged into 'Release\_medium'.  'area' can be merged into 'artist' as attributes. The 'has' relation between 'Release\_medium' and 'track' is merged into 'track' using 'mid' as foreign key. So is the 'copy' relation between 'recording' and 'track' using 'id' of recording as foreign key.\\ \\
Additionally, we ignore the 'count' in 'genre', which could be created as view in the database.\\ \\

\section{Analyze the Queries}

We've already created 8 indexes:\\
\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL, keywordstyle=\color{blue!70},
commentstyle=\color{red!50!green!50!blue!50},
rulesepcolor=\color{red!20!green!20!blue!20},
frame=shadowbox]
create bitmap index genderindex
on  artist(gender); 

create bitmap index typeindex
on artist(type);

create bitmap index areaindex
on artist(area_name);

create index nameindex
on artist(name);

create index artrack
on  artist_track(aid);

create index artracktid
on  artist_track(tid);

create index genreindex
on artist_genre(gid);

create index tracktid
on track(mid);
\end{lstlisting}

We choosed Query H, Query I and Query J.

\subsection{Query H}

An AID-index is built on TABLE artist\_track because it can speed up the range scan(In the SQL, we used only AID for this TABLE, so it's obvious that we should use this index).\\
There is a bitmap index built on area\_name for TABLE artist to quickly group the artists by attribute "area\_name". It will take much more time to grasp the number of artists in every area if we don't have this index (there are 264690 areas and 815387 artists, thus may cost about O($10^{10}$) for grouping without area-indexing). \\
The system also used the bitmap index on gender for TABLE artist, since bitmap indexes are compact and they work best for columns with a small set of values(the attribute "gender" contains only 3 kinds of value: "Male", "Female" and "Other"). Then we can quickly partition artists from areas by gender. \\
Finally, we succeeded in running the query in \textbf{about 30s}. The join(artist and artist\_track) takes most of time(60\%+ of IO cost) since both contain a large amount of data, and relatively little time with group(by gender and area\_name, about 20\% IO cost) when we use the indexes.\\

\subsection{Query I}
The indexes are built on attribute name on for TABLE artist, and indexes of tables of their own. In the plan explaition, we can see that all IO cost by table access is very little thanks to the indexes.\\
We ran the query in \textbf{539 ms}. The "exists" cost most of the IO cost.\\
\includegraphics[width=14cm]{costi}

\subsection{Query J}
The indexes used are gender-index on TABLE artist and gid-index on TABLE genre. For gender-index, we've already discuessed in anlysis for Query H. And for gid-index, it managed to fast-full scan for the "group by gid". Thus, the indexes are important when we do such kind of queries(especially for "GROUP BY").\\
The query cost \textbf{7270 ms}. 50% of the IO cost is on the "join"(it's foreseeable since it really cost when we need to join the 2 large tables), and another 50% of the IO cost is on the outer "GROUP BY" (since the cardinality is very large). Other part of the query(table access, inner group by and select) cost very little.

\section{Interface}
Since we've already upload the data to the server, it's convient for us to use PHP + Apache + Oracle to build the website as interface, like below:\\ \\
\includegraphics[width=14cm]{interface1}\\ \\
It's the index of our website. The website contains 4 parts: Home, Data, Query and About, and the functionally page is Data and Query.\\ \\
The screen shot of Data page is as below, the page shows the data of tables(you can select the table you want to see by clicking the link of table names, which are the yellow words on the uper part of the page). Each page would show 20 data and you can blowse more data by click the link of pages on the bottom part of the page. As the screen shot, it shows the 'artist' table. By moving your mouse onto those foreign keys, a prompt box showing the message of the table linked by the foreign key or relationship(as the screen shot, we move the mouse onto the 'genre' and a box showing message of the genre name and genre id of the artist).\\ \\
\includegraphics[width=13cm]{interface2}\\ \\
Under each row there's a input box, and you can use it to search for keyword. Just by clicking the "Keyword Search" you can filter the data of the table. For example, next screen shot shows the result as we input 'China' and 'Female' under keyword 'AREA\_NAME' and 'GENDER'. \\ \\
\includegraphics[width=13cm]{interface3}\\ \\
And in the data\_modify page, we implement the insert and delete of data. Once given paremeters and clicked "run", the SQL ran will be printed and the SQL will be executed. The result is as below. We've already tested and this function is available.\\ \\
\includegraphics[width=13cm]{interface5}\\ \\
And we satisfied all the queries(A-S) in the Query page, and you can see the results by clicking the query number.\\ \\
