\section{ER model}
After reading the feedback of diverable1, we modified our ER model as below:\\ \\
\includegraphics[width=14cm]{ERmodel}\\ \\
In the given project data, we firstly recognize 'area', 'artist' and 'genre' each as three individual entities. Each artist is from at most one area, so it's a many-to-one relation. Several artists can belong to different genres and one genre can contain several artists. So the relation between 'artist' and 'genre' is many-to-many.\\ \\
Secondly, we think about the relationship among 'release', 'recording', track' and 'medium'. We imagine a scene to describe these relations. The csv file of 'release' contains the names of releases. They could be stored in the mediums, such as CD, 12‚Äù Vinyl and so on. What's more, one release could have several CDs to contain many tracks, or in different medium (I'm not sure about this, but possible). So the relation between 'release' and 'medium' is one-to-many. Next, each track in different mediums must correspond to one recording. So the relation between 'track' and 'recording' is many-to-one. Each 'track' must be in one of 'medium's. So the relation is many-to-one.\\ \\
Finally, we merge one-to-may relations. 'release' and 'medium' are merged into 'Release\_medium'.  'area' can be merged into 'artist' as attributes. The 'has' relation between 'Release\_medium' and 'track' is merged into 'track' using 'mid' as foreign key. So is the 'copy' relation between 'recording' and 'track' using 'id' of recording as foreign key.\\ \\
Additionally, we ignore the 'count' in 'genre', which could be created as view in the database.\\ \\

\section{Alternative based on Real Data}
\normalsize{
When importing the real data, we find several problems. So we decide to change the schema in order to import as much data as possible. \\ \\
In our ER model, we merged the 'area' and 'artist'. However, since the data is not incomplete, a few AreaIDs in 'artist' don't appear in 'area', such as 'AreaID=241'. So we use an 'area' entity instead. And the foreign key in 'artist' is disabled. Other foreign key constraints, except in 'medium', are also disabled to make it easy to import data. Additionally, in the original file of 'artist.csv', we change '\\N' to '0', which is null in the 'area' table.\\ \\
Another problem with the data is deplicate, since the data in artist\_track has duplicate, we set the foreign-key disabled in the table artist\_track.\\ \\
We separate the release\_medium table into 'release' and 'medium', considering the limited space. Because the name of release could be very long. Duplication could  cause a waste of memory. But the foreign key in 'medium' is still retained, because it works.\\ \\
In the 'genre' entity, 'count' is remained for further possible queries(We find that 'count' from real data is not really the count we caculate).\\ \\}
